# ML ASSIGNMENT 3-REGRESSION


## Objective: 
#### The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your understanding of regression techniques in supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset.

## Dataset: 
#### Use the California Housing dataset available in the sklearn library. This dataset contains information about various features of houses in California and their respective median prices. 

## Key Components to be Fulfilled: 

## 1. Loading and Preprocessing (2 marks): 
####     Load the California Housing dataset using the fetch_california_housing function from sklearn. 
####     Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling. 
####     Handle missing values (if any) and perform necessary feature scaling (e.g., standardization). 
####     Explain the preprocessing steps you performed and justify why they are necessary for this dataset.

## 2. Regression Algorithm Implementation (5 marks): 
### Implement the following regression algorithms: 
####     a.Linear Regression 
####     b.Decision Tree Regressor 
####     c.Random Forest Regressor 
####     d.Gradient Boosting Regressor 
####     e.Support Vector Regressor (SVR) 

### For each algorithm: 
####     Provide a brief explanation of how it works. 
#v     Explain why it might be suitable for this dataset.
    
## 3. Model Evaluation and Comparison (2 marks): 
### Evaluate the performance of each algorithm using the following metrics: 
####     a.Mean Squared Error (MSE) 
####     b.Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
####     c.R-squared Score (RÂ²) 

### Compare the results of all models and identify: 
####     The best-performing algorithm with justification. 
####     The worst-performing algorithm with reasoning.
